# MNIST-Machine-Learning-Model
Implements an MNIST model using PyTorch, NumPy, and MatplotLib. The model uses backpropogation with different layers to achieve 98% accuracy. This work was completed in a team of three, where I did work in setting up the model, creating layers, backpropogation, and tuning hyperparameters.

## Building
This project can be built on Google Colab, please replace the following lines with your Google Drive folders as necessary
```
torch.save(model.state_dict(), '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/ENGR96 Machine Learning/weights.pth')
```
```
